# List of pipelines to be loaded by Logstash
#
# This document must be a list of dictionaries/hashes, where the keys/values are pipeline settings.
# Default values for omitted settings are read from the `logstash.yml` file.
# When declaring multiple pipelines, each MUST have its own `pipeline.id`.
#
# Example of two pipelines:

# - pipeline.id: main
#   pipeline.batch.size: 125
#   path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/main.conf"
   
 - pipeline.id: exim-pipeline
   pipeline.batch.size: 125
   queue.type: persisted
   path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/exim.conf"
   
 - pipeline.id: dovecot-pipeline
   pipeline.batch.size: 125
   queue.type: persisted
   path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/dovecot.conf"
